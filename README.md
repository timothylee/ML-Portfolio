# ML-Portfolio
A repository to house and showcase all of my Machine Learning projects from Udacity.

Please note that these are Jupyter Notebook files written in MarkDown and Python 2.7.

- Model Evaluation & Validation: Apply basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home
- Unsupervised Learning: Apply unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data
- Supervised Learning: Apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause
- Reinforcement Learning: Apply reinforcement learning techniques for a self-driving agent in a simplified world to aid it in effectively reaching its destinations in the allotted time
- Image Classification: Classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a convolutional neural network with max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers
- Capstone: Predict outcomes for a Kaggle Red Hat competition using Random Forest versus XGBoost
